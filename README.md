## Project Proposal

We aim to build a website application that allows for translation between different languages by typing on it. This also aims to display useful information to the users depending on the language selected, facilitating not only the language comprehension, but also helping them understand the cultural differences. This app does not only work with real languages, but also with fiction languages, which makes it fun as well! As optional milestones, we would like to research about voice recognition and text to speech, and implement some APIs capable of those features if available.

APIs used: 
YodaTranslator, MinionTranslator, KlingonTranslator, PirateTranslator, GoogleTranslate, BrailleTranslator, MorseCode, FerbLatinTranslator, ReadSpeaker, GunganTranslator, SithTranslator.

Tasks  list:
Website Layout Design
API Documentation Research & Testing
PseudoCode Website Functionality
API Integration
Firebase Integration
Website Testing and Debugging
Slideshow Design for Presentation.
